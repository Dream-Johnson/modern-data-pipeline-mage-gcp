# 🧠 Modern Data Pipeline with Mage.ai, Google Cloud, BigQuery & Looker

A complete end-to-end data engineering project that builds a modern ELT pipeline using Mage.ai, hosted on a Google Cloud VM, with data warehousing in BigQuery, exploratory data analysis in Python, and dashboarding in Looker.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up and run a modern data pipeline using open-source and cloud-native tools:

- Mage.ai is used for ingestion, transformation, and orchestration.
- The server runs on a Google Cloud virtual machine.
- Data is transformed and loaded into BigQuery.
- A Looker dashboard visualizes the final output for stakeholders.
- EDA and data profiling are done in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
